# Aspireathon Project by Meta-four

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a 4-in-1 donation system which includes Crowdfunding, Fundraising, Crowdsourcing and Auctioning. 

## Steps to follow:

### `Fork the repository and clone to your local system`

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies into your folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Connect to Node.js Backend

### Running the server

In a separate terminal, type `node server.js` to get the server running. To test whether it is running, you can load `https://localhost:8082` and a 'Hello World; will be displayed.


##  Other Commands - Don't use right now!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
